# Execution Plan Summary (Applied)

1. Audit dependency/tool readiness for junction and Stage-12 workflows.
2. Create missing entrypoints and standardize workflow README sections (`Inputs`, `Command`, `Outputs`).
3. Add reproducibility verification assets (output manifest + checksum script).
4. Apply temporary AAF-filter disable in Stage-12 R script.
5. Regenerate Stage-12 CJD+dilutions outputs.
6. Record tools/packages versions and reference-artifact provenance with placeholders.
7. Save execution artifacts and report under `doc/Codex_to_do/`.
