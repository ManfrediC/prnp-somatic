## Targeted sequencing by probe-based hybridisation capture

Next, we sequenced the entire PRNP gene using DNA extracted from xxx frontal cortex samples. In order to assess whether the frequency of mutations in PRNP might differ from other genomic loci with similar biochemical properties, we included two control loci in the genes TET2 and TTN. The control loci were chosen to approximately match the GC content and length of the PRNP protein coding region. The human reference genome GRCh38 was used for all probe design, alignment, preprocessing, variant calling and annotation steps.

Spike-in sample production: To evaluate the limit of detection and baseline noise rate of the targeted sequencing workflow described below, spike-in samples were produced by adding 0.5% and 1% of mutant gDNA (A117V was chosen based on availability) to non-mutant gDNA (Promega).

SureSelect library preparation: A customised Agilent SureSelectXT HS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) probe-based targeted capture panel was designed using the Sure-Design online platform. The panel contained biotinylated RNA probes directed against the entire PRNP gene (Chr20:4686134-4701605), as well as against two control loci in the genes TET2 (Chr4:105233897- 105237351) and TTN (Chr2:178741921-178739141). Probes binding spliced PRNP exon-exon junctions were also included (Ensembl transcripts ENST00000379440, ENST00000430350 and ENST00000457586.1). 200 ng genomic DNA was fragmented to an average size of 350 bp, using an LE220-plus Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) with the following settings: 25% Duty Factor, 220W Peak Incident Power, 50 cycles per burst, 1 mm y-axis dither at 20 mm s-1, 10 degC bath temperature, 115 s treatment time. Sequencing libraries were prepared following the manufacturer's instructions, with the modifications described below. In brief, fragments underwent end-repair and dA-tailing, followed by ligation to barcoded adaptor oligonucleotides and purification with AMPure XP beads. The adaptor-ligated libraries underwent pre-capture PCR as follows: 2 min at 98 degC; 9 cycles of 30 s at 98 degC, 30 s at 60 degC and 60 s at 72 degC; followed by a final elongation for 5 min at 72 degC. Amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads. Amplicon size and quantity of pre-capture libraries were assessed on an Agilent 4200 Tapestation, using D1000 ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies). Next, 500-1000 ng of pre-capture DNA library were incubated with SureSelect XT HS Low Input blocker mix and SureSelect RNase block, followed by hybridisation to the customised probe panel described above. Hybridised DNA was captured using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed 6 times with SureSelect Wash Buffer at 70 degC. The SureSelect-enriched DNA libraries underwent post-capture PCR as follows: 2 min at 98 degC; 16 cycles of 30 s at 98 degC, 30 s at 60 degC and 60 s at 72 degC; followed by a final elongation for 5 min at 72 degC. The amplified libraries were purified with AMPure XP beads and quality control was performed on an Agilent 4200 Tapestation with High-Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies). 

Sequencing: The target-enriched library amplicons were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with deconvolution of sample indices, following the manufacturer's instructions. 

## Variant calling and annotation

Data preprocessing: An overview of the data analysis pipeline is given in Figure 3. A customised version of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v4.5) best practice preprocessing workflow for somatic short variant discovery was used for data preprocessing, with other GATK tools being used for subsequent analysis steps as described later [26]. Sequence reads underwent stringent preprocessing with Trimmomatic (v0.39) (29), involving trimming of low-quality bases (quality score <10) from both the 5' and 3' ends (LEADING:10, TRAILING:10), as well as a sliding window approach of four bases requiring an average quality >=25 (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25). Reads exhibiting an average quality score below 30 were discarded, and only those with >80 bp length were retained (AVGQUAL:30, MINLEN:80). Trimmed reads were then aligned to the human reference genome using bwa-mem (v0.7.17) [27]. Aligned read indexing and sorting was performed using SAMtools (v1.20) [28]. Duplicate reads were annotated with Picard (v2.23.0). To correct systematic errors included during sequencing, base quality score recalibration and indel realignment were performed with BaseRecalibrator. The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP>132), Mills indels, 1000 Genomes indels and gnomAD databases, derived from the GATK resource bundle, served as references for known variant sites [29-33].

Variant Calling and Filtering: We began by identifying somatic mutations with GATK Mutect2 in non-diseased control brain samples, with the approach being defined by sample type: (i) control samples were analysed using a "tumour-only" approach without a Panel of Normals (PoN); then (ii) spike-in samples were surveyed using a PoN generated with control samples, after verification that the control did not contain evidence of exonic PRNP mutations (see below for details), with the objective of identifying the limit of detection; (iii) finally, CJD samples were processed using the PoN and the detection limit established by analysis of the spike-in samples.

For all groups, Mutect2 was run with standard settings, using reference databases drawn from the GATK resource bundle. Next, read orientation bias artefacts were modelled using GATK LearnReadOrientationModel with 50 expectation-maximisation iterations. Mutect2 VCF outputs were then filtered with GATK FilterMutectCalls [30], incorporating the results of orientation bias modelling. 

Normalisation and Annotation: Filtered VCF files generated from the Mutect2 and FilterMutectCalls analysis were normalised with bcftools by applying multi-allelic site decomposition and left-alignment of indels [28]. Next, variants were annotated using GATK Funcotator to predict functional consequences and integrate external annotations. To reflect probe design, annotation was performed against a custom hg38-derived reference genome containing chromosomes 2, 4, and 20. The Funcotator pre-packaged data source (version 1.8.hg38, released 2023-09-08) was used, querying the public databases GENCODE [34], ClinVar [35], COSMIC [36], dbSNP [31], gnomAD exome and genome subsets [33], HGNC [37], Achilles [38], ORegAnno [39], and UniProt [40]. In addition, bcftools annotate was used to annotate allele frequency data from gnomAD, to help distinguish potential germline variants from true somatic mutations.

Read and base quality metrics: To identify read and base quality metrics for the identified variants, the genomic positions of variant sites were extracted from previously generated annotated VCF files and formatted into BED files. Samtools was used to remove reads flagged as duplicates (0x400) from the recalibrated BAM files, which had been generated in the preprocessing stage of the analysis pipeline. Next, variant-specific read- and nucleotide-level metrics, including  chromosomal coordinates, reference and alternate base counts, base quality and mapping quality, were collected from the BAM files for each variant using bam-readcount [41]. The resulting output was then converted into a tabular format using a custom Python workflow.

Variant Data Extraction and Quality Control Criteria: The normalised and annotated VCF files were converted into a tabular format using GATK VariantsToTable, encompassing genomic coordinates, reference and variant alleles, allele frequencies, gnomAD frequencies, and functional annotations. A custom R pipeline was then employed to integrate the base and mapping quality data derived from bam-readcount and to implement quality control filtering. This filtering was adapted from best-practice criteria formulated by the Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network [42] or previously used for deep targeted panel sequencing [43].

In summary, variants were retained only if they met the following selection requirements: (i) location within genomic regions covered by the hybridisation-capture probes used for sequencing; (ii) presence of a Mutect2 PASS tag, indicating a high-confidence somatic call; (iii) the variant was supported by >=10 alternate reads, with  >=3 reads on each DNA strand, at a total read depth of >=100; (iv) minimum mean base quality and read quality values of 20; (v) the variant was either absent or recorded at an allele frequency of <0.001 in gnomAD and dbSNP; (vi) the variant-allele fraction (VAF) was significantly different from 0.5 (consistent with a non-germline origin), as determined by a two-sided binomial test with p < 10-6; and (vii) VAF was >0.0081, based on the threshold identified in our limit-of-detection analysis.

Panel of Normals: Having verified that the control samples did not contain exonic PRNP mutations, they were defined as normals and used to create a Panel of Normals (PoN), with the purpose of improving specificity in somatic mutation detection. VCF files from six control samples were merged using bcftools, indexed, and processed with GATK CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals to produce the final PoN VCF. Mutect2 variant calling was performed for all dilutions and CJD samples, this time incorporating the newly created PoN. Subsequently, orientation bias modelling, filtering, annotation, quality metric extraction and variant quality control were performed as detailed above. 

Sequencing metrics: Sequencing quality metrics were generated per sample from the final analysis-ready BAM files using a customised Python pipeline. In sumamry, for each sample, computed read-level mapping statistics (total reads, mapped reads, primary mapped reads, duplicate reads, and QC-failed reads) were computed from BAM flags, alongside on-target enrichment and coverage metrics within two predefined genomic interval sets defined in BED files: (i) the capture target regions (chr20:4,686,134-4,701,605, chr4:105,233,897-105,237,351, and chr2:178,739,141-178,741,921) and (ii) the PRNP protein coding region (chr20:4,699,221-4,699,982). Depth and coverage summaries (mean, median, 20th percentile depth, Fold-80 defined as mean/P20, and the proportion and count of bases above pre-specified depth thresholds) were derived from samtools depth outputs restricted to the relevant BED intervals, applying a minimum mapping quality filter of MAPQ >=20. For the capture targets, on-target fraction was calculated as the proportion of primary mapped reads overlapping the target intervals.
