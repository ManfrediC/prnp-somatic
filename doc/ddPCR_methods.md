# Droplet digital PCR

All brain samples included in the study were analysed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for the highly pathogenic PRNP variants E200K, D178N and P102L. E200K is associated with genetic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, D178N is associated with genetic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease or fatal familial insomnia — depending on the codon 129 polymorphism on the same allele [8] — and P102L is associated with Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker disease.

**Sample preparation:** The ddPCR reactions were prepared in a dedicated pre-PCR workspace with template gDNA, fluorescent hydrolysis probes, 2x ddPCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad) and nuclease-free water. To prepare the template, 130 ng of gDNA extracted from bulk tissue were digested with HindIII-HF (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 60 min. Every reaction plate contained PRNP mutant or single-gene controls (SGCs), where appropriate, together with wild-type (WT) controls and no template controls (NTCs). WT controls were prepared with commercially available human gDNA containing a reference PRNP allele (Human Genomic DNA, mixed; Cat. Nr. G3041; Promega AG, Dübendorf, Switzerland). NTCs were prepared after completion of all other reaction mixes to control for cross-contamination. Reaction droplets were produced with a QX200 Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and PCRs were performed as published [24]: 10 min at 95 °C; 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 60 s at 60 °C; followed by 10 min at 98 °C and cooling to 12 °C. Droplet fluorescence data were acquired on a QX200 Droplet Reader. Quality control and data analysis were carried out using QuantaSoft Analysis Pro (Bio-Rad). Wells showing signs of inefficient amplification, poor droplet quality, or fewer than 10,000 accepted droplets were excluded from further analysis.

**Single nucleotide variant analysis:** To search for pathogenic PRNP single nuclotide variants (SNVs), we used commercially available 40x TaqMan SNP Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) targeting the E200K (Chr20:4699818, Assay ID C__27531205_10) and D178N (Chr20:4699752, Assay ID C____574563_20) variants. A customised hydrolysis probe assay was designed for the variant P102L (Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, human; Chr20:4699525; forward primer: 50-GTGGCACCCACAG TCAGT-30; reverse primer: 50-GCAGCACCAGCCATGTG-30; wild type probe sequence: VIC-50-TTGGCTTACTCGGCTTGT-30-NFQ, mutant probe sequence: FAM-50-TGGCTTACTCAGCTTGT-30-NFQ). DNA was quantified spectrophotometrically. Mutant controls were prepared with gDNA containing the appropriate heterozygous PRNP variant and amplified and analysed as described above. All wells containing mutant gDNA were prepared in a separate workspace to avoid contamination. To classify droplets as positive or negative, fluorescence amplitude thresholds were set based on NTCs (which were classified as double-negative), WT (PRNP WT-positive, mutant-negative) and PRNP mutant controls (PRNP WT-positive, mutant-positive). Droplet cluster counts were converted to template counts expressed in copies per microlitre (cpm).

**Limit of detection analysis:** To empirically determine the analytical sensitivity of the ddPCR assays, artificial mosaic samples were prepared for the variants D178N, E200K and P102L. Genomic DNA from heterozygous carriers of each variant was mixed with commercially available wild-type gDNA (Promega Human Genomic DNA, see above) to generate predefined final variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of 1%, 0.33%, 0.1% and 0.05%.

**Data processing:** An analysis pipeline was created, following digital MIQE guidelines [25]. Raw droplet fluorescence data were exported from QuantaSoft Analysis Pro (Bio-Rad) and processed in R (v.4.3.2) using the tidyverse and binom packages. Files were batch-imported and annotated with sample identifiers and targeted variant (E200K, D178N, or P102L). Fractional abundance (FA) was defined as the ratio of mutant to total copies. Where sample availability allowed for sample–assay combinations with multiple wells, droplet counts were aggregated across wells, and FA with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated using the exact binomial (Clopper–Pearson) method. For single wells, FA was calculated as above and 95% confidence intervals were obtained from Poisson modelling of droplet partitioning as implemented in QuantaSoft. Final estimates combined pooled and single-well data, yielding per-sample FA values with CIs. One incidentally discovered E200K-heterozygous germline carrier (CJD30) was excluded from E200K mosaicism analyses.

**Limit of blank:** In order to rule out false positives from background noise, the limit of blank (LoB) was computed for every plate. Droplets were gated manually using NTC, WT, and mutant controls. For each assay and plate, WT and NTC control wells were pooled to estimate the blank false-positive rate (p₀). The expected distribution of false-positive droplets was modelled as a binomial process with sample-specific n equal to the number of accepted droplets. The LoB was defined as the 95th percentile of this distribution, corresponding to the number of false positives expected with 5% probability under the blank model. To render LoB values comparable across samples, they were normalised to droplet count and expressed as a fractional abundance threshold (LoBFA). If a plate lacked blanks, an assay-wide p₀ pooled across plates was used as a conservative fallback. Samples with mutant-positive droplets exceeding the LoBFA were classified as above background.

**Limit of detection:** The analytical sensitivity of the SNV assays was assessed experimentally using artificial mosaics prepared by mixing non-mutant gDNA (Promega) with gDNA purified from tissues of mutation carriers (E200K, D178N, P102L, respectively). Mixtures contained predefined variant allele fractions of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.33% and 1%, and were analysed in parallel with controls.

**Participant-level pooling and quantification:** For summary analyses at the participant level, mutant-positive and total accepted droplets were aggregated across all available tissue regions per participant and assay. Participant-level fractional abundance (FA) and 95% confidence intervals (Clopper–Pearson) were calculated as described above. For each participant–assay combination, the maximum p₀ across contributing plates was used. The participant-level limit of blank (LoB) was then defined as the 95th binomial quantile with n equal to that participant’s total accepted droplets and expressed as a fractional abundance threshold (LoBFA), as detailed above.

**Definition of mutation-positive samples:** A sample was considered mutation-positive only if the lower 95% confidence interval of the variant allele fraction exceeded both the assay-specific limit of blank (LoB) and the experimentally defined limit of detection (LoD).
