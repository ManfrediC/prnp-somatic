# Legacy authoritative_files (archival)

This directory is an archived snapshot of earlier development work.
It is **not** used by the current reproducible workflow.

The canonical, maintained versions live in the repository root under:
- authoritative_files/

Do not edit files here unless you are intentionally updating the historical archive.
